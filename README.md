# 014-Five-Ways-To-Pass-Data-In-iOS-And-UITabBarController

**Description**: A demo that shows five ways to pass data between ViewControllers, including Segues in Storyboard, Delegate Pattern, Passing Blocks, Key-value Observation and NSNotification. 

* Besides showing the data passing mechanism, other functions includes:
* Use PaintCode to draw the icons in the TabBar and UIView 
* Explore PaintCode’s frame function and  scale the icons to different sizes 
* Generate image using template mode and dynamically change the image / icon color 
* Extended UIColor so it can be initiated with UIColor(color: UIColor, alpha: CGFloat) 
* Explore TabBar and UITabBarController, including custom icon, system icon, badge, and “More” icon
* Keep consistent UIView in different orientation
